# Tunedly – Flask Application with Authentication & Access Control

#### Video Demo: <URL>

## Overview
Tunedly is a Python Flask web application built to practice secure authentication, session handling, and user-scoped data access. The project focuses on implementing and validating common web application security concepts rather than frontend complexity.

## Security-Relevant Features
- User authentication with password hashing
- Session-based access control
- User-specific data isolation
- Server-side authorization for CRUD operations
- Secure profile update and account deletion workflows

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Database: SQLite
- Authentication: Password hashing & session management
- Frontend: Minimal HTML/CSS for functional interaction

## Security Concepts Practiced
- Authentication flow analysis
- Access control enforcement
- Prevention of unauthorized data access (IDOR awareness)
- Input validation and server-side trust boundaries
